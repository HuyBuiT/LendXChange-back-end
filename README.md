# LendXChange Backend

This repository contains the backend server for **LendXChange**, a decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform. The server is developed using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework, and is responsible for handling API requests, business logic, and interactions with the database and blockchain components.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lendxchange-backend.git
   cd lendxchange-backend
   ```


2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard NestJS modular architecture:


```bash
src/
├── app.module.ts        # Root module
├── main.ts              # Entry point of the application
├── modules/             # Feature modules
│   ├── account/         # Account management module
│   ├── loans/           # Loan management module
│   ├── offers/          # Offer management module
│   └── ...              # Additional modules
├── common/              # Common utilities and services
└── config/              # Configuration files
```


## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following variables:


```env
# Server configuration
PORT=3000

# Database configuration
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=your_db_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DATABASE_NAME=your_db_name

# JWT configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=3600s

# Other configurations
...
```


Ensure that the database is running and accessible with the provided credentials.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available via Swagger. Once the application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api` to access the Swagger UI.
