# About LendXChange: 
  LendXChange is a decentralized P2P lending platform that connects lenders and borrowers directly on SUI. 
  It offers a wide range of offer templates, the borrowing asset is ALWAYS USDC, and the collateral asset is ALWAYS SUI.
  The offer templates include: USDC amount (100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000) and fixed duration is ALWAYS 14 days, so lender just need to consider about their offer interest rate.
  A loan will be liquidated if the collateral value falls below 120% of the borrowed amount or if the loan duration exceeds 14 days.
